This is mostly focused on Random Forests, but you can find some implementations of Decision Tree too, since they're pretty similar (Decision Tree is an inferior version of Random Forest).

### Random Lending Forests.
Random Lending Forests.ipynb uses loan_data.csv for its dataset. You can also obtain the dataset from https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action
